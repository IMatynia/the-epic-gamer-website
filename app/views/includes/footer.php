                <div>Matyniov's Corp. | Most right reserved, i think? I mean, the website is my idea, the code was written by me, the contents of the articles and quizes are also bright examples of my imagination, but the images are mostly links to external sources for the sake of server space saving. I think thats not that big of a deal, right?</div>
